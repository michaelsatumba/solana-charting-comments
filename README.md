**Design Decisions**
I explored various websites for inspiration and developed my own design by incorporating elements from popular platforms.

**Additional Features and Improvements**
Feature 1: I would have add more time ranges in the graph.
Feature 2: I would have added a database for the comments section.
Code Refactoring: I would have spent a feew more hours - even days on refactoring code.
Testing: I would have done more unit testing.
Documentation: I would have improved the documentation for this project.
