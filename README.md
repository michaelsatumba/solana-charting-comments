**Design Decisions**
<br>
I explored various websites for inspiration and developed my own design by incorporating elements from popular platforms.

**Assumptions**
<br>
I was allowed to use React and TailwindCSS

**Additional Features and Improvements**
<br>
Feature 1: I would have add more time ranges in the graph.<br>
Feature 2: I would have added a database for the comments section.<br>
Code Refactoring: I would have spent a few more hours, even days on refactoring code.<br>
Testing: I would have done more unit testing.<br>
Documentation: I would have improved the documentation for this project.<br>
